# Statistics & Probability in Data Science & Machine Learning

Statistics and probability are fundamental tools in data science and machine learning.

* **Statistics**: Analyzes data, identifies patterns, measures relationships, and draws conclusions.
* **Probability**: Estimates the likelihood of events happening, crucial for predictions and model evaluation.

Together, they enable:

* **Feature analysis and understanding**: Statistics helps identify relevant data features, while probability estimates their influence on outcomes.
* **Prediction and model evaluation**: Statistics helps identify trends and relationships, while probability allows estimating the likelihood of predictions and evaluating model performance.

These tools play a critical role in making sense of data and building powerful algorithms.
