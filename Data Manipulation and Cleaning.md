# Data Manipulation and Cleaning

Techniques for working with messy real-world data.

Data manipulation and cleaning are essential steps in any data analysis project. Real-world data is often messy and inconsistent, and it is important to clean it up before you can start to analyze it. Data manipulation and cleaning techniques can be used to fix errors, remove duplicate data, and format the data so that it is consistent.

Some common data manipulation and cleaning techniques include:

**Removing duplicate data:** Duplicate data can occur for a variety of reasons, such as human error or data entry errors. It is important to remove duplicate data so that your analysis is not skewed.
**Fixing errors:** Data errors can also occur for a variety of reasons. It is important to fix errors so that your analysis is accurate.
**Formatting data:** Data can be formatted in a variety of ways. It is important to format your data so that it is consistent so that you can easily analyze it.
Handling missing data: Missing data can also be a problem. There are a number of ways to handle missing data, such as removing rows with missing data or imputing missing values.

Data manipulation and cleaning can be a time-consuming process, but it is an important step in any data analysis project. By cleaning your data, you can ensure that your analysis is accurate and reliable.

The cycle starts with importing data, and then proceeds to data cleaning, verification and enrichment, de-duplication, standardization, normalization, and exporting data. The cycle can be repeated as needed until the data is clean and ready for analysis.
